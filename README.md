# Fanserver-Redux


## About This Project

** An environment has been set up! Please feel free to check out my work-in-progress! **

** Just click the 'environment' tab just above and to the left of the green 'clone' button! THANKS!  **

A remake of FanServer; an app I built for a section capstone for Thinkful (Bootcamp)

I really want to make this a more full-featured app with things like pagination, filters, a nicer UI, animations and perhaps some authentication.

## Tools Used

* HTML
* SASS/SCSS
* Plain-ol' Vanilla JavaScript
* Love

## Current Progress

### Pagination
So, I've never created anything with pagination before, I wasn't really sure what to expect. I thought that it could be easy, but that sometimes the easy-sounding features can turn out muddier a process than you(I) expected!
